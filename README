### PROBLEMS, BUGS, REPORTS ##
If you are having issues with this app, please contact me at cpuspy.realgpp@gmail.com! 

If you are experiencing some problem and you would like to get rid of it, you can enable the verbose option from Settings so that the app will generate a logfile of all the operation it does. Then, when a problem happens, you can send me at cpuspy.realgpp@gmail.com the "CpuSpy.log" file stored in the mass storage that contains much more informations than the default android error report procedure. This way it will be easier and faster to solve the bug for me :)

!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!
If you see the message "No states found" when the app starts it means the app can't read the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state. This is NOT an app related error. The solutions to the problem is to contact your ROM/kernel developer and let him know about this problem.

!!!!!! NON ROOTED DEVICES !!!!!!
To have a rooted devices it's not mandatory but however depends by the kernel of the ROM. For example tha app works on Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Ace, both of them on their stock ROMS

Permissions explained:

android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: to delete some internal variables on each reboot.
android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: used to write log messages to the file CpuSpy.log (if verbose option is enabled)
android.permission.BATTERY_STATS: only to READ the battery juice lost when timer is set

android.permission.INTERNET and android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE are used only for the ad banners
