[*] Ability to reset/restore the timers when the cable is unplugged/plugged. thereshold customizable.
[*] You can group togheter all the stats which percentage of use is under a customizable thereshold of.
[*] Added infos about battery juice lost since last reset.
[*] Added lots of UI changes, like a 2nd UI layout with buttons.
[*] Added "Cpu Files" menu item to see the content of the files: time_in_state and affected_cups.
[*] Added settings to handle all the new features.
[*] and more...

Permissions explained:
android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: to delete the some internal variables.
android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: used to write log messages to the file CpuSpy.log (if verbose option is enabled)
android.permission.BATTERY_STATS: to the battery juice lost when timer is set

!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!

If you see the error "No states found" when the app starts it means the app can't read the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state. This IS NOT an app related error. The solutions to the problem is to contact your ROM/kernel developer and let him know about this problem.
